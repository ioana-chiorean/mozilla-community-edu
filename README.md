## Mozilla Community Education Platform
* Fork of [P2PU Course](http://howto.p2pu.org/) in a Box 
* Which leverages the [Jekyll Blogging Software](http://jekyllrb.com/)

##Mozilla Customizations
* Added support for *heirarchy of courses*.  For example 'Mentoring' is a top level course topic.  Mozilla Reps Mentoring and Firefox might be two types of Mentoring we offer training for.
* To create Modular content*, we build curriculum in this [community_curriculum repo](), and include it as a git submodule in _includes.  We can of course include any remote repository, and include remote content this way.  Instead of writing content directly in module files we 'include' markdown files from our includes folder.


## How do I get started?

1. [howto.p2pu.org](http://howto.p2pu.org), has the basics for forking repositories and using gh-pages. 
2. Reach out directly to me, or post on the Community Education Discourse forum.
